# Training the Decision Tree Regression model on the whole dataset
#
# We don't apply feature regression on DTR model: the predictions
# from the decision tree are resulting from successive splits of the data,
# throught the nodes of the tree and therefore there are not
# some equiations like with other models. the split can be done 
# with the orignal values, even if they are in different scales
#
# The only difference with RTM is that the predictions are made
# by using a whole set of trees, specified by the n_estimators parameter
